# More about script
- Based on GTA V Online garages, we have included low-end (2 vehicles), mid-end (6 vehicles), and high-end (20+ vehicles) interior options. Each garage can have an unlimited number of floors. Ownership follows the same system as GTA Online, allowing multiple players to own the same garage. If a garage has entity sets, they can be added to the customization menu—we’ve included the most popular ones. The script will automatically detect your framework and install the SQL. However, if your framework is renamed, you will need to edit `init.lua`. The script will continue using the `owned_vehicles`/`player_vehicles` table in the database, so do not remove it.
